# VIMFILES

Yes, this is absolutely a me too repo. This configuration is used
by me on a daily basis in my favorite Vim version: MacVim.

## To get started

1. From your terminal:
<pre>
cd ~
git clone git://github.com/sparkboxx/vimfiles.git
ln -s ~/path/to/vimfiles ~/.vim
ln -s ~/path/to/vimfiles/vimrc ~/.vimrc

cd ~/.vim
git submodule init
git submodule update
</pre>

2. Install ACK

Make sure Ack is installed on your computer for the Ack plugin to work. 
On a mac a simple 

    brew install ack

Probably does the trick.


3. You're all set


## What in there?

In no particular order:

* Fugitive/Git: Git VC right from Vim.
